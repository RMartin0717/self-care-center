## About
This was my first project for Turing School of Software & Design in which I was responsible for coding across HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My task was to build out a comp based on a provided image of a Self Care Center web page.

For the Minimum Viable Product, I needed to create a "Receive Message" button with functionality to display a random message from either a list of affirmations or a list of mantras. This message replaces a meditation image.

I chose to also build a feature that would allow the user to favorite a message, which would be added to a list of favorite messages and viewable on a page accessed by clicking the "View Favorites" button. Users can navigate back to the main page by clicking on "Back to Main" and remove favorited messages by clicking on "Remove From Favorites."

In addition, I researched and utilized Local Storage, which allowed me to work across two separate HTML pages with their own Javascript pages. I used this to store an array of favorites that the user can access and modify on refresh and while moving back and forth between the main page and the favorites page.
